# LTE 4G Network KPI Anomaly Detection
To detect anomalies in LTE network performance across Gambia for a telecom operator by analyzing a year-long dataset of LTE KPIs. An LLM-based interface allows users to query specific sites and time ranges, triggering a trained anomaly detection model to identify abnormal behavior




# 🚀 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Anomaly Detection System for LTE 4G network KPIs, designed to identify abnormal network behaviors at the cell and site level. Leveraging advanced machine learning and time series analysis, our solution enables telecom operators to proactively detect, visualize, and interpret anomalies—leading to better network reliability and improved customer experience.
